Innerfuse Pascal Script 3 (short IFPS3) is a script engine written in
Delphi. IFPS3 allowes you to use parts of Object Pascal language within
your Delphi projects at runtime. It's a set of units that can be
compiled into your exe file so there is no need to distribute any
external files. IFPS3 compiles first and allows to execute the script
later.<br>

<b>About parameters</b><br>
Parameters are pushed from Right to Left so the first parameter is
always pushed last. The result (if there is one) is pushed as the very
last parameter.<br>
<br>
Var parameters are pushed on the stack the same way except that instead
of copying a variable, it's pushed directly on it and the refcount is
increased. The result is also pushed like a var parameter.<br>
<br>
<b>About importing classes</b><br>
"All public and published properties need to be registered, unless they
were already registered by an ancester class"<br>
<br>
"Public properties need to be registered using a property helper at
runtime since there is no typeinfo generated for them"<br>
<br>
"All public and published methods and constructors need to be
registered, unless they are overriden or dynamic (not supported)"<br>
<br>
"Destructors may not be registered, use TObject.Free instead"<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">About importing interface</span><br>
Interfaces have to be registered only at compile time, at runtime you
only have to register the interface support functions (ifps3.pas)<br>
For interfaces it's important to always correctly specify the ancester
interface and all functions, if there is a function that's not
supported, use the AddDummy function.<br>
